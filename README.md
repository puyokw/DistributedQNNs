# Distributed Quantum Neural Networks via Partitioned Features Encoding

## Examples
In this repository, 
we put the jupyter notebooks used in our numerical experiments. 

- mnist28x28_14qnn20_c4.75.ipynb: classifying MNIST data set (28x28) with 14 QNNs
- semeion16x16_4qnn20+c10.ipynb: classifying Semeion data set (16x16) with 4 qnns
- semeion16x16_8qnn20+c5.ipynb: classifying Semeion data set (16x16) with 8 qnns
- semeion8x8_2qnn20+c20.ipynb: classifying reduced sized  Semeion data set (8x8) with 2 qnns
- semeion8x8_qnn20+c35.ipynb: classifying reduced sized  Semeion data set (8x8) 1 qnn
