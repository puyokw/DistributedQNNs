# Distributed Quantum Neural Networks via Partitioned Features Encoding
The paper of "Distributed quantum neural networks via partitioned features encoding" can be read at [Quantum Machine Intelligence](https://rdcu.be/dAVb9). Here, we put the codes used in the paper. 

## Examples
In this repository, 
we put the jupyter notebooks used in our numerical experiments. 

- mnist28x28_14qnn20_c4.75.ipynb: classifying MNIST data set (28x28) with 14 QNNs
- semeion16x16_4qnn20+c10.ipynb: classifying Semeion data set (16x16) with 4 qnns
